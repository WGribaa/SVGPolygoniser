# SVGPolygoniser
A module that reads your SVG files (paths and vector graphic) and is able to categorize data given 2D coordinates.

This project is but a draft, now. But it gives some features :
- Read SVG file, extracts forms and tranforms them into matplotlib's paths.
- Transformation of coordinates (from a box to another)
- Provides a method to categorize datas from a list or series.

This project is currently stil private because the material provided is part of an evaluate ongoing project at the IA School (as part of the Data Science Master cursus).

Incoming features :
- Calculates and returns the center of each polygon.
- Tells the total area of a polygon.
- Another py module which will use shapely : https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/ for increased performance and easier improvability.
